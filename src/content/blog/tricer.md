## Development and Technologies Used

Liquid: Liquid was used as a template engine to manage the dynamic content of the store. This allowed to customize product pages and collections efficiently, facilitating inventory and promotions updates.
## 
HTML: The store structure was built using HTML, ensuring a solid, semantic foundation that improves accessibility and SEO. Each product is presented with detailed descriptions, high-quality images and technical specifications.
## 
Tailwind CSS: For the design, we opted for Tailwind CSS, a utilitarian CSS framework that allowed us to create a modern and responsive design. Using predefined classes, a clean and attractive design was achieved that enhances the user experience on mobile and desktop devices.
## 
JavaScript: Interactive features were implemented with JavaScript, such as product filters, dynamic shopping carts and real-time notifications. This not only improved usability, but also increased customer satisfaction by making the checkout process smoother.
